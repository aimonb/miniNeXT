Mininet Extreme Installation/Configuration Notes
----------------------------------------

1. Clone the repository to a chosen location

  Note: if you downloaded a ZIP from GitHub, rename the resulting directory
  from mininet-extreme-master to mininet-extreme

2. Installation on Ubuntu 12.10+

  To install Mininet and dependencies (Quagga, OpenVPN) in developer mode:

      `sudo mininet-extreme/util/install.sh -fovz`

  Note: this installs Quagga and patches /etc/init.d/quagga
   
3. Launching an example topology

  An example is included of a Mininet network consisting of a legacy
  switch and five Quagga routers (legacy routers). To launch, execute:

      `sudo python mininet-extreme/quagga.py`

  Each Quagga router will read from its own configuration space,
  stored within: 

      `mininet-extreme/examples/quaggacfgs/NAME`. 

  In addition, each Quagga instance will log to it's own location within:

      `/var/log/quagga-`

  and store its PID files within:

      `/run/quagga-NAME`. 

  These directories and permissions will be automatically created and 
  configured if necessary. To launch this topology, execute:

      `sudo python mininet-extreme/examples/quagga.py`
      
  It is recommended that you do not attempt to access the `bgpd` console
  directly from the Mininet shell, as there are some interface issues
  (typed characters appear twice, backspace does not work, etc.). 
  Instead, use the following to connect to a Quagga `bgpd` console:
  
      # launch a shell in the container namespace
      `mininet-extreme/util/m <container name (a1, b1, rs, etc)>`
      
      # connect to bgpd via netcat
      `nc localhost 2605`
      `password: bgpuser`

4. Removing Mininet Extreme

  To remove the core Mininet Extreme binaries and libraries:

      `sudo python mininet-extreme/setup.py develop --uninstall`

  Note: this does not remove dependencies, such as Quagga

Good luck!
